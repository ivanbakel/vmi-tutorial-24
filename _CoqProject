# A _CoqProject file is a cross-IDE and build-system file which describes how
# the files in your Coq project are laid out.

# "-Q" sets how to map files and folders into a namespace
# For example:
# -Q src my_custom_project_namespace
-Q examples examples

# Lines which are file and folder names are included in the project
# For example
# src/my_file.v
#
# This includes "my_file.v" from the directory "src" in the project. If combined
# with the above "-Q" directive, then the modules in "my_file.v" will appear under
# the "my_custom_project_namespace" namespace.
#
# All the files in a folder can also be included
# For example
# src/
#
# This includes all the Coq files in the directory "src".
